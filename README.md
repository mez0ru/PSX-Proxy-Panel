## Stack
Uses Tailwind + HeadlessUI + React.

## About
The UI is done from the ground-up by myself, the frontend is designed to be a SWA \
for PSX proxy server, it should be able to make requests to the server (i.e. add a game) \
and receive information such as metrics, games, from the activity of the server. \
The goal is to make it easier to maintain new games, have a better presentability, and
more functionalities for the backend proxy server. \
Eventually the old "Automatic game updates" standalone program will be migrated to the proxy server, \
for better maintability and better user experience.

## License
Whatever license, the backend code is proprietary (for now) while the frontend is opensource; \
however, leave credit where credit is due if you plan on using it.
